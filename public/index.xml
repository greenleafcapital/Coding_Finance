      <description>In this post we will download and clean the Fama/French 3 factors model data. First we will download the data like we did in the previous post.
To keep it brief we will execute the entire code at once.
import urllib.requestimport zipfileff_url = &amp;quot;https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/ftp/F-F_Research_Data_Factors_CSV.zip&amp;quot;# Download the file and save it# We will name it fama_french.zip fileurllib.request.urlretrieve(ff_url,&amp;#39;fama_french.zip&amp;#39;)zip_file = zipfile.ZipFile(&amp;#39;fama_french.zip&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;r&amp;#39;)# Next we extact the file data# We will call it ff_factors.</description>

      <description>In the last post we learned to download the FF data. In this post we will learn to clean the data so we can use it for our analysis.
First lets load the libraries and the data.
library(tidyquant)library(timetk)ff_url &amp;lt;- &amp;quot;https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/ftp/F-F_Research_Data_Factors_CSV.zip&amp;quot;temp_file &amp;lt;- tempfile()download.file(ff_url, temp_file)ff_data_raw &amp;lt;- read_csv(unzip(temp_file), skip = 3)## Warning: Missing column names filled in: &amp;#39;X1&amp;#39; [1]## Parsed with column specification:## cols(## X1 = col_integer(),## `Mkt-RF` = col_double(),## SMB = col_double(),## HML = col_double(),## RF = col_double()## )## Warning in rbind(names(probs), probs_f): number of columns of result is not## a multiple of vector length (arg 1)## Warning: 8 parsing failures.</description>

      <description>We will perform the same step as we did in the last post. This time we will do it in Python. We will need a few libraries to download our data. We will use the urllib.request for downloading the file and zipfile to extract the content of the zip file.
import urllib.requestimport zipfileOnce we have imported the modules, we are ready to download the files from the website.</description>

      <description>In this post we will show you how to use R to download Fama French 3 factor model data from their website. You can find the data on their website at “https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html” We will select and download the Fama/French 3 factors monthly data.
Lets begin!
Since we will just be learning how to download the data and not perform any analysis, we won’t need to load any libraries.
First we will need to copy the link of the data that we are trying to download.</description>

      <description>Welcome Like most college students in Finance major I used Excel a lot. Excel is great and works well for millions of people, but it has its limitations. I have always loved tinkering with computers and a few year ago discovered Python &amp;amp; R. Soon it became clear to me that these programming languages can be used to solve many financial problems. But learning these languages can be challenging for many.</description>

      <description>In this post we will demonstrate how to use python to calculate the optimal portfolio and visualize the efficient frontier.
In this post we will only show the code with minor explanations.
Lets begin with loading the modules.
import pandas as pdimport numpy as npimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport pandas_datareader as webNext we will get the stock tickers and the price data.
tick = [&amp;#39;AMZN&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;AAPL&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;NFLX&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;XOM&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;T&amp;#39;]price_data = web.</description>

      <description>Portfolio optimization is an important topic in Finance. Modern portfolio theory (MPT) states that investors are risk averse and given a level of risk, they will choose the portfolios that offer the most return. To do that we need to optimize the portfolios.
To perform the optimization we will need
To download the price data of the assetsCalculate the mean returns for the time periodAssign random weights to the assets and then use those to build an efficient frontierSo lets begin</description>

      <description>Calculating IRR in PythonCalculation of IRR in Python is easy with the numpy module.
Why do we need to calculate the IRR or Internal rate of returns?
Let us suppose a manager has an opportunity to invest in two projects, but can only choose one project. The projects are:
Project 1 requires $800 million in investment today, but it will pay 200,250,300,350,400 million in payments each year for the next 5 years.</description>

      <description>In this article we will perform the same time value of money calculations using Python. First let us import the necessary modules/libraries.
import pandas as pdimport numpy as npimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltCreating a pandas dataframe.
# Setting interest rate to 5%r = 0.05cf = pd.DataFrame({&amp;#39;Year&amp;#39;:[1,2,3,4,5], &amp;quot;cash_flow&amp;quot;:[100,100,100,100,100]})cf[&amp;quot;pv&amp;quot;] = cf[&amp;#39;cash_flow&amp;#39;] / (1.0 + r)**cf[&amp;#39;Year&amp;#39;]npv = cf[&amp;quot;pv&amp;quot;].sum()print(cf)## Year cash_flow pv## 0 1 100 95.</description>

      <description>In this article we will perform basic financial calculations in R.
Calculating the Net Present Value (NPV)Financial problems such as valuing an asset can be solved by calculating its net present value. The underlying principle in the calculation is that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar a year from now. This principle was well known to our ancestors thousands of year ago.</description>
