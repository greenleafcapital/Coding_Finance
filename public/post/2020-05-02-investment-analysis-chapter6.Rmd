In this post we will solve the end of the chapter practice problems from chapter 6 of the [book](https://www.amazon.com/Quantitative-Investment-Analysis-CFA-Institute/dp/111910422X).

### Problem 1

Peter Biggs wants to know how growth managers performed last year. Biggs
assumes that the population cross-sectional
standard deviation of growth manager
returns is 6 percent and that the returns are independent across managers.

- A How large a random sample does Biggs need if he wants the standard deviation
of the sample means to be 1 percent?
- B How large a random sample does Biggs need if he wants the standard deviation
of the sample means to be 0.25 percent?

We know that

![](https://www.gstatic.com/education/formulas/images_long_sheet/en/standard_error.svg)

```{r}

# Population sd is 0.06
pop_sd <- 6/100

# The standard deviation or standard error of the sample mean is σX = σ / sqrt(n)
# 0.01 = pop_sd / sqrt(n)

n = (pop_sd / 0.01) ** 2

cat("Biggs need", n, "samples, if he wants the standard deviation
    of the sample means to be 1 percent")

```

A - Biggs need 36 samples, if he wants the standard deviation of the sample means to be 1 percent

```{r}

n = (pop_sd / 0.0025) ** 2

cat("Biggs need", n, "samples, if he wants the standard deviation
    of the sample means to be 0.25 percent")

```

B - Biggs need 576 samples, if he wants the standard deviation of the sample means to be 0.25 percent

As standard error decreases, the sample size increases.

### Problem 2

Petra Munzi wants to know how value managers performed last year. Munzi
estimates that the population cross-sectional
standard deviation of value manager
returns is 4 percent and assumes that the returns are independent across
managers.

- A Munzi wants to build a 95 percent confidence interval for the mean return.
How large a random sample does Munzi need if she wants the 95 percent
confidence interval to have a total width of 1 percent?
- B Munzi expects a cost of about $10 to collect each observation. If she has
a $1,000 budget, will she be able to construct the confidence interval she
wants?


```{r}
# We know population sd

pop_sd <- 0.04

# se is s/sqrt(n) # standard error
# we have to find n
# but before that we need to find se
# 95% confidence interval means
# 2.5% in each tail

lower_tail <- qnorm(0.025, lower.tail = T)
uppper_tail <- qnorm(0.025, lower.tail = F)

cat("lower tail", lower_tail,"\n",
    "upper tail", uppper_tail)

```

So we need our 95% confidence interval to have a 1% width.

```{r}

# Assuming X as our mean and se as our sample sd
# We have (X + 1.96se) − (X − 1.96se) = 1% 
# which is equal to 2*(1.96se) = 1%
# se = 0.01 / (2 * 1.96)

se <- 0.01 / (2 * uppper_tail)
cat("The standard deviation of sample mean is,", se, "\n\n\n")

# Now find the n

n <- (0.04 / se) ** 2
cat("Munzi needs a sample size of", round(n),  "if she wants the 95 percent
confidence interval to have a total width of 1 percent")

```

A - Munzi needs a sample size of 246 if she wants the 95 percent
confidence interval to have a total width of 1 percent

B - With her \$1000 budget Munzi can only afford 100 observations which is far short of 246 she needs to have a 1% width of her confidence interval. 

### Problem 3

Assume that the equity risk premium is normally distributed with a population
mean of 6 percent and a population standard deviation of 18 percent. Over
the last four years, equity returns (relative to the risk-free
rate) have averaged
−2.0 percent. You have a large client who is very upset and claims that results
this poor should never occur. Evaluate your client’s concerns.

- A Construct a 95 percent confidence interval around the population mean for
a sample of four-year
returns.
- B What is the probability of a −2.0 percent or lower average return over a
four-year
period?

```{r}

# Assuming normal distribution
# Pop mean
m <- 6/100

# Pop sd
s <- 18/100

# we need the se for last 4 years
# se is the sample sd
# se = sd / sqrt(4)

se <- s / sqrt(4)

# 95% confidence interval will
# have 2.5% in each tail

# upper limit
upper_limit <- qnorm(0.025, m, se,lower.tail = F)

# lower limit

lower_limit <- qnorm(0.025, m, se,lower.tail = T)

cat( "A 95 percent confidence interval around the population mean for
a sample of four-year
returns has upper limit of",
upper_limit, "and a lower limit of", lower_limit)
```

A - There is a 95% probability that returns will fall between ~23.7% and ~-11.64%

```{r}

# lower limit is -2%

# Probability of getting
# -2% or lower returns over a 4 year period is

p <- pnorm(-0.02,mean = m, sd = se, lower.tail = T)

cat("The probability of a −2.0 percent or lower average return over a
four-year
period is", p)



```

B- The probability of a −2.0 percent or lower average return over a
four-year period is 0.1870314

### Problem 4

Compare the standard normal distribution and Student’s t-distribution.

See below plots for comparison

```{r}

x <- seq(-4,4,length = 1000)

# normal distribution
d_x <- dnorm(x)

# df = degrees of freedom
# t distribution with 2 df
d_x1 <- dt(x, 2)

# t distribution with 5 df
d_x2 <- dt(x, 5)

# make our tibble
# plot the chart

tibble(x = x,
       d_x = d_x,
       d_x1 = d_x1,
       d_x2 = d_x2) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = d_x, color = 'normal\ndistribution')) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_line(aes(x = x, y = d_x1, color = 't with\ndf = 2')) +
  geom_line(aes(x = x, y = d_x2, color = 't with\ndf = 5')) +
  labs(x = 'x',
       y = 'f(x)',
       title = 'Comparing Normal Distribution with t distribution') +
  scale_colour_discrete("Distributions") +
  theme_classic() +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0))
  

```

### Problem 5

Find the reliability factors based on the t-distribution for the following confidence
intervals for the population mean (df = degrees of freedom, n = sample
size):

- A A 99 percent confidence interval, df = 20.
- B A 90 percent confidence interval, df = 20.
- C A 95 percent confidence interval, n = 25.
- D A 95 percent confidence interval, n = 16

```{r}

# As we did in Problem 4
# we will use the t() functions

# 99% with df = 20

level <- (1 - 0.99)/2
df <- 20

f1 <- qt(level, df = df, lower.tail = F)

cat("A 99 percent confidence interval, df = 20 is", f1)


```
A - A 99 percent confidence interval, df = 20 is 2.84534

```{r}

# 90% with df = 20

level <- (1 - 0.90)/2
df <- 20

f1 <- qt(level, df = df, lower.tail = F)

cat("A 90 percent confidence interval, df = 20 is", f1)


```

B - A 90 percent confidence interval, df = 20 is 1.724718

```{r}

# 95% with n = 25
# df = n - 1

n = 25
df <- n - 1

level <- (1 - 0.95)/2

f1 <- qt(level, df = df, lower.tail = F)

cat("A 95 percent confidence interval, n = 25 is", f1)


```

C - A 95 percent confidence interval, df = 25 is 2.063899

```{r}

# 95% with n = 16
# df = n - 1

n = 16
df <- n - 1

level <- (1 - 0.95)/2

f1 <- qt(level, df = df, lower.tail = F)

cat("A 95 percent confidence interval, n = 16 is", f1)


```

D - A 95 percent confidence interval, n = 16 is 2.13145

### Problem 6

Assume that monthly returns are normally distributed with a mean of 1 percent
and a sample standard deviation of 4 percent. The population standard deviation
is unknown. Construct a 95 percent confidence interval for the sample
mean of monthly returns if the sample size is 24.

```{r}

# pop mean
m <- 1/100
# sd
s <- 4/100

# sample
n <- 24
df <- n - 1

# 95% conf interval

level <- (1 - 0.95) / 2

# Calculate the se

error <- qt(level, df = df, lower.tail = F) * (s / sqrt(n))

upper <- m + error
lower <- m - error

cat("A 95 percent confidence interval will fall between", lower, "and", upper)


```

A 95% confidence interval will fall between -0.006890519 and 0.02689052

### Problem 7

Ten analysts have given the following fiscal year earnings forecasts for a stock:

```{r echo=FALSE}

f <- c(1.4,1.43,1.44,1.45,1.47,1.48,1.5)
n <- c(1,1,3,2,1,1,1)

df <- tibble(`Forecast` = f,
       `Number of Analysts` = n)

df %>% kable() %>%
  kable_styling(fixed_thead = T)

```

Because the sample is a small fraction of the number of analysts who follow
this stock, assume that we can ignore the finite population correction factor.
Assume that the analyst forecasts are normally distributed.

- A What are the mean forecast and standard deviation of forecasts?
- B Provide a 95 percent confidence interval for the population mean of the
forecasts.

```{r}
# Forecast
f <- c(1.4,1.43,1.44,1.45,1.47,1.48,1.5)

# number of analysts
n <- c(1,1,3,2,1,1,1)

# total analyst
num <- sum(n)

# calculate weights
w <- n / sum(n)

# Weighted Mean
m <- weighted.mean(f, w)

cat("Mean Forecast is", m)
cat("\n")
# Standard Deviation

v <- sum(n * (f - m) ** 2) / (num - 1)
s <- sqrt(v)
cat("Standard Deviation is", s)

```

A - Mean Forecast is 1.45 and the Standard Deviation is 0.02788867

```{r}

# 95% confidence Interval

level <- (1 - 0.95) / 2
df <- num - 1


error <- qt(level,df = df,
            lower.tail = F) * (s/sqrt(10))

upper <- m + error
lower <- m - error

cat("Upper and Lower limits are", upper,'\n', lower)

```

Upper and Lower limits are 1.46995 and 1.43005

### Problem 8

Thirteen analysts have given the following fiscal-year
earnings forecasts for a stock

```{r, echo=FALSE}

f <- c(0.7,0.72,0.74, 0.75,0.76,0.77,0.82)

n <- c(2,4,1,3,1,1,1)

df <- tibble(Forecast = f,
       `Number of Analyst` = n)

df %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling()

```

Because the sample is a small fraction of the number of analysts who follow this
stock, assume that we can ignore the finite population correction factor.

- A What are the mean forecast and standard deviation of forecasts?
- B What aspect of the data makes us uncomfortable about using t-tables to
construct confidence intervals for the population mean forecast?

```{r}


# Forecasts
f <- c(0.7,0.72,0.74, 0.75,0.76,0.77,0.82)

# number of analyst
n <- c(2,4,1,3,1,1,1)

# Total analyst
num <- sum(n)

# weights of each forecast
w <- n / sum(n)

# Calculate the weighted mean
m <- weighted.mean(f,w)

# Calculate the SD
# variance
v <- sum(((f - m)^2) * n) / (num - 1)

# SD

s <- sqrt(v)


cat("The mean forecast is,", m, "and the standard deviation of forecast is,",s)

```

A - The mean forecast is, 0.74 and the standard deviation of forecast is, 0.03265986

```{r}
# Get the forecast from all analysts
x <- rep(f,n)

# plot the histogram of the forecast

ggplot(aes(x = x), data = NULL) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50)

```

B - The sample is small, and the distribution of the forecast appear to be bimodal, and we cannot compute the confidence intervals as the distribution appears to be not normal.

### Problem 9

Explain the differences between constructing a confidence interval when sampling
from a normal population with a known population variance and sampling
from a normal population with an unknown variance


For a known standard deviation: we use the formula ![](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/444d7dcc9754f1a624090b0a71068ff914176eb3)

For an unknown standard deviation we use the formula ![](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/953450702f09946ea8f70bc38628be8e3a39f6ae)

### Problem 10

An exchange rate has a given expected future value and standard deviation.

- A Assuming that the exchange rate is normally distributed, what are the probabilities
that the exchange rate will be at least 2 or 3 standard deviations
away from its mean?
- B Assume that you do not know the distribution of exchange rates. Use
Chebyshev’s inequality (that at least 1 − 1/k2 proportion of the observations
will be within k standard deviations of the mean for any positive integer k
greater than 1) to calculate the maximum probabilities that the exchange
rate will be at least 2 or 3 standard deviations away from its mean.


```{r}

# We know the z value

# When z is 2

z_2 <- (1 - pnorm(2)) * 2

# When z is 3

z_3 <- (1 - pnorm(3)) * 2

cat("The probability that the exchange rate will be at least 2 standard deviations away from the mean is", z_2, "and 3 standard deviations away from the mean is", z_3)






```

A - The probability that the exchange rate will be at least 2 standard deviations away from the mean is 0.04550026 and 3 standard deviations away from the mean is 0.002699796

```{r}

# Since the distribution is unknown and using Chevychev's theorem

# when k = 2

k_2 <- (1 - (1/2)^2)

# when k = 3
k_3 <- (1 - (1/3)^2)

cat("The maximum probabilities that the exchange
rate will be at least 2 standard deviations away from its mean is", 1 - k_2, 
"or 3 standard deviations away from its mean is", 1- k_3)


```

We can see that when the distribution is unknown and using Chebychev's theorem, the probabilities of getting extreme data increases.

### Problem 11

Although he knows security returns are not independent, a colleague makes
the claim that because of the central limit theorem, if we diversify across a
large number of investments, the portfolio standard deviation will eventually
approach zero as n becomes large. Is he correct?

As we increase the number of securities, the standard deviation will get lower but not approach zero. This has nothing to do with the central limit theorem, but due to correlation of different assets.

### Problem 12

Why is the central limit theorem important?

### Problem 13

What is wrong with the following statement of the central limit theorem?

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greenleafcapital/cf_images/master/ch6_sampling/prob_13.png)

- First the sample size `n` has to be large (above 30)
- The distribution will have a mean approximately equal to population mean

### Problem 14

Suppose we take a random sample of 30 companies in an industry with 200
companies. We calculate the sample mean of the ratio of cash flow to total debt
for the prior year. We find that this ratio is 23 percent. Subsequently, we learn
that the population cash flow to total debt ratio (taking account of all 200 companies)
is 26 percent. What is the explanation for the discrepancy between the
sample mean of 23 percent and the population mean of 26 percent?

- A Sampling error.
- B Bias.
- C A lack of consistency.

A Sampling error

### Problem 15

Alcorn Mutual Funds is placing large advertisements in several financial publications.
The advertisements prominently display the returns of 5 of Alcorn’s
30 funds for the past 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year
periods. The results are indeed
impressive, with all of the funds beating the major market indexes and a few
beating them by a large margin. Is the Alcorn family of funds superior to its
competitors?

Selecting only 5 out of 30 funds may indicate selection bias. We will have to analyze the performance of all the funds to come to a conclusion if Alcorn family of funds is superior to its competitors.

### Problem 16

Julius Spence has tested several predictive models in order to identify undervalued
stocks. Spence used about 30 company-specific
variables and 10
market-related
variables to predict returns for about 5,000 North American
and European stocks. He found that a final model using eight variables applied
to telecommunications and computer stocks yields spectacular results. Spence
wants you to use the model to select investments. Should you? What steps
would you take to evaluate the model?

If you test so many variables, there is a high probability that some variables will be statistically significant. It would have been surprising, if there were no varibales that yielded spectacular results. 

To test the model we should question the models and make sure it makes economic sense. We should also split the data and test the model on an out of sample data.


### Probllem 17

The best approach for creating a stratified random sample of a population
involves:

- A drawing an equal number of simple random samples from each
subpopulation.
- B selecting every kth member of the population until the desired sample size
is reached.
- C drawing simple random samples from each subpopulation in sizes proportional
to the relative size of each subpopulation

C drawing simple random samples from each subpopulation in sizes proportional
to the relative size of each subpopulation

### Problem 18

A population has a non-normal
distribution with mean μ and variance σ2. The
sampling distribution of the sample mean computed from samples of large size
from that population will have:

- A the same distribution as the population distribution.
- B its mean approximately equal to the population mean.
- C its variance approximately equal to the population variance.

B its mean approximately equal to the population mean.

### Problem 19

A sample mean is computed from a population with a variance of 2.45. The
sample size is 40. The standard error of the sample mean is closest to:

- A 0.039.
- B 0.247.
- C 0.387.

```{r}
# pop variance
v <- 2.45
s <- sqrt(v)

# size = 40
size <- 40

# se = standard error

se <- s / sqrt(size)

cat('The standard error of the sample mean is closest to:', se)



```

B 0.247

### Problem 20

An estimator with an expected value equal to the parameter that it is intended
to estimate is described as:

- A efficient.
- B unbiased.
- C consistent.

B unbiased 

An unbiased estimator is one for which the expected value equals the parameter it is intended to estimate

### Problem 21

If an estimator is consistent, an increase in sample size will increase the:

- A accuracy of estimates.
- B efficiency of the estimator.
- C unbiasedness of the estimator

A accuracy of estimates.



### Problem 22

For a two-sided
confidence interval, an increase in the degree of confidence will
result in:

- A a wider confidence interval.
- B a narrower confidence interval.
- C no change in the width of the confidence interval.

A a wider confidence interval.

### Problem 23

As the t-distribution’s degrees of freedom decrease, the t-distribution most
likely:

- A exhibits tails that become fatter.
- B approaches a standard normal distribution.
- C becomes asymmetrically distributed around its mean value.

A exhibits tails that become fatter.

### Problem 24

For a sample size of 17, with a mean of 116.23 and a variance of 245.55, the
width of a 90% confidence interval using the appropriate t-distribution is closest
to:

- A 13.23.
- B 13.27.
- C 13.68.

```{r}

# mean 
m <- 116.23

# variance 
v <- 245.55

# sd
s <- sqrt(v)

# size 
size <- 17

# alpha 0.1
a <- 0.1

# at 90% confidence interval and
# df = size - 1
t_a <- qt(a/2, df = size - 1, lower.tail = F)

error <- t_a * (s / sqrt(size))

upper <- m + error
lower <- m - error

interval <- upper - lower

cat("the width of a 90% confidence interval using the appropriate t-distribution is closest
to:", interval)


```

B 13.27

### Problem 25

For a sample size of 65 with a mean of 31 taken from a normally distributed
population with a variance of 529, a 99% confidence interval for the population
mean will have a lower limit closest to:

- A 23.64.
- B 25.41.
- C 30.09.

```{r}

# Normal Distribution
# size 
size <- 65

# mean 
m <- 31

# variance
v <- 529

# sd 
s <- sqrt(v)

# alpha 0.01
a <- 0.01

# at 99% confidence interval and
# df of size - 1

t_a <- qnorm(a/2)

error <- t_a * (s / sqrt(size))

lower <- m + error
cat("A 99% confidence interval for the population
mean will have a lower limit closest to:", lower)

```

A 23.65

### Problem 26

An increase in sample size is most likely to result in a:

- A wider confidence interval.
- B decrease in the standard error of the sample mean.
- C lower likelihood of sampling from more than one population.

B decrease in the standard error of the sample mean.

### Problem 27

A report on long-term
stock returns focused exclusively on all currently publicly
traded firms in an industry is most likely susceptible to:

- A look-ahead
bias.
- B survivorship bias.
- C intergenerational data mining.

B survivorship bias.

### Problem 28

sample
test?
