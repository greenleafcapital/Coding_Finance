We will perform the same step as we did in the last post. This time we will do it in Python. We will need a few libraries to download our data. We will use the `urllib.request` for downloading the file and `zipfile` to extract the content of the zip file.

```{python}

import urllib.request
import zipfile

```

Once we have imported the modules, we are ready to download the files from the website.

```{python}

# Create the download url

ff_url = "https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/ftp/F-F_Research_Data_Factors_CSV.zip"

# Download the file and save it
# We will name it fama_french.zip file

urllib.request.urlretrieve(ff_url,'fama_french.zip')

```

Next we will open the file

```{python}

# Use the zilfile package to load the contents, here we are
# Reading the file

zip_file = zipfile.ZipFile('fama_french.zip', 'r')

# Next we extact the file data
# We will call it ff_factors.csv

zip_file.extractall('ff_factors.csv')

# Make sure you close the file after extraction
zip_file.close()

```

Next we can use pandas package to read the csv file. We already know that the first 3 rows are unnecessary so we will skip those rows.

```{python}

import pandas as pd

ff_factors = pd.read_csv('F-F_Research_Data_Factors.csv', skiprows = 3)

print(ff_factors.head())

```

Success Again this data needs to be cleaned, which we will do in the next post.
