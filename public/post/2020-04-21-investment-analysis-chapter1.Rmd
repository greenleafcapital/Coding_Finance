In this post we will solve the end of the chapter practice problems from chapter 1 of the [book](https://www.amazon.com/Quantitative-Investment-Analysis-CFA-Institute/dp/111910422X).

Here are the first 4 problems and their solutions in R

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greenleafcapital/cf_images/master/tvm/tvm_pp_1_to_4.png)

### Problem 1A

Investment 1 and 2 have the same maturity and default risks. However investment 2 has low liquidity and therefore investment 2 has a higher interest rate of 0.5% to compensate for the liquidity risk. This is the liquidity risk premium.

### Problem 1B

Investment 4 and 5 have the same maturity (8 years). We know from problem 1 the liquidity risk premiums is 0.5%. The interest rate difference between Investment 4 and 5, is 2.5%. Investment 5 has low liquidity and high default risk therefore it has a higher interest rate. Since we know 0.5% is the liquidity premium, we can attribute 2.5% - 0.5% = 2% as default risk premium.

### Problem 1C

Investment 2 and 3 has the same liquidity and default risk, but investment 3 has a higher maturity hence it should have atleast 2.5% as the lower bound. Investment 3 and 4 has low default risk. But investment 3 has a lower maturity and lower liquidity. We know the liquidity premium is 0.5%, but we don't know the compensation for extra year of maturity. Therefore we could expect the interest rate for investment 3 to be between 2.5% and 4.5%.


### Problem 2


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)

savings <- 20000
interest <- 7/100
years <- 20
timeline <- rep(20000,years)

# Create a function to calculate the future value
# of payments

get_payment_fv <- function(x,y) {
  
  payment <- (1 + interest) ^ (years - y) * x
  return(payment)
  
}

payments <- map2_dbl(.x = timeline,.y = 1:years,
                 .f = get_payment_fv)

print(timeline)
print(payments)
cat("The couple will have", paste0("$",round(sum(payments),2)),
    "at the end of 20 years.")

```

### Problem 3

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

cash_flow <- c(0, 0, 20000, 20000, 20000, 0, 0)
interest <- 9/100
years <- length(cash_flow)

payments <- map2_dbl(.x = cash_flow,
                     .y = 1:years,
                     .f = get_payment_fv)

cat("The client will have", paste0("$",round(sum(payments),2)),
    "at the end of 6 years.")
```

### Problem 4

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

college_fee <- 75000
interest <- 6/100
years <- 5

pv <- (1 + interest) ^ (-years) * college_fee

cat("The father will need to invest", paste0("$",round(pv,2)),
    "today to have $75000 in 5 years at 6%")
```
