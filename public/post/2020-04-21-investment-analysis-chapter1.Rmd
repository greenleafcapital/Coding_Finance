In this post we will solve the end of the chapter practice problems from chapter 1 of the [book](https://www.amazon.com/Quantitative-Investment-Analysis-CFA-Institute/dp/111910422X).

#### Here are the first 6 problems and their solutions in R

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greenleafcapital/cf_images/master/tvm/tvm_pp_1_to_6.png)

### Problem 1A

Investment 1 and 2 have the same maturity and default risks. However investment 2 has low liquidity and therefore investment 2 has a higher interest rate of 0.5% to compensate for the liquidity risk. This is the liquidity risk premium.

### Problem 1B

Investment 4 and 5 have the same maturity (8 years). We know from problem 1 the liquidity risk premiums is 0.5%. The interest rate difference between Investment 4 and 5, is 2.5%. Investment 5 has low liquidity and high default risk therefore it has a higher interest rate. Since we know 0.5% is the liquidity premium, we can attribute 2.5% - 0.5% = 2% as default risk premium.

### Problem 1C

Investment 2 and 3 has the same liquidity and default risk, but investment 3 has a higher maturity hence it should have atleast 2.5% as the lower bound. Investment 3 and 4 has low default risk. But investment 3 has a lower maturity and lower liquidity. We know the liquidity premium is 0.5%, but we don't know the compensation for extra year of maturity. Therefore we could expect the interest rate for investment 3 to be between 2.5% and 4.5%.


### Problem 2


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)

savings <- 20000
interest <- 7/100
years <- 20
timeline <- rep(20000,years)

# Create a function to calculate the future value
# of payments

get_payment_fv <- function(x,y) {
  
  payment <- (1 + interest) ^ (years - y) * x
  return(payment)
  
}

payments <- map2_dbl(.x = timeline,.y = 1:years,
                 .f = get_payment_fv)

print(timeline)
print(payments)
cat("The couple will have", paste0("$",round(sum(payments),2)),
    "at the end of 20 years.")

```

### Problem 3

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

cash_flow <- c(0, 0, 20000, 20000, 20000, 0, 0)
interest <- 9/100
years <- length(cash_flow)

payments <- map2_dbl(.x = cash_flow,
                     .y = 1:years,
                     .f = get_payment_fv)

cat("The client will have", paste0("$",round(sum(payments),2)),
    "at the end of 6 years.")
```

### Problem 4

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

college_fee <- 75000
interest <- 6/100
years <- 5

pv <- (1 + interest) ^ (-years) * college_fee

cat("The father will need to invest", paste0("$",round(pv,2)),
    "today to have $75000 in 5 years at 6%")
```

### Problem 5

```{r}

interest <- 5/100
years <- 10

df <- tibble(year = 1:years,
       cf = rep(100000,10)) %>%
  mutate(pv = cf / (1 + interest)^ year)

print(df)

lump_sum <- sum(df$pv)

cat("The client should expect", paste0("$",round(lump_sum, 2)), "payment today.")

```

### Problem 6A

```{r}

cf1 <- c(0,0,0,rep(20000,4))

interest <- 8/100

df <- tibble(year = 1:length(cf1),
             cf = cf1) %>%
  mutate(pv = cf / (1 + interest)^ year)

print(df)

pv <- sum(df$pv)


cat("We should be willing to pay",paste0("$",round(pv,2)),"for the first investment")


```

### Problem 6B

```{r}

cf2 <- c(rep(20000,3), 30000)
interest <- 8/100

df <- tibble(year = 1:length(cf2),
             cf = cf2) %>%
  mutate(pv = cf / (1 + interest)^ year)

cat("We should be willing to pay",paste0("$",round(pv,2)),"for the second investment")

             cf = cf) %>%
  mutate(pv = cf / (1 + interest)^ year)

```

### Problem 8

```{r}

# This is a two part problem
# First calculate the PV of 
# Room and board required 
# before college starts

cf1 <- rep(20000,4)
interest <- 5/100

df1 <- tibble(year = 1:length(cf1),
       cf = cf1) %>%
  mutate(pv = cf / (1 + interest)^ year)

fv <- sum(df1$pv)

cat("The client will need", fv, 
    "before college starts.")

# Now we need to calculate the
# payment needed to get this 
# Future value

# We will use the FV value of annuity formula

# FV = annuity((1 + r)^N - 1 / r)
# we need to make 17 payments

annuity <- fv / (((1 + interest)^17 - 1) / 0.05)

cat("The parent will need to make", paste0("$",round(annuity,2)), "to save for room and board")

```

### Problem 9

```{r}

# First we need to calculate the
# Inflation adjusted cost of college
# in the future

tuition_today <- 7000
college_start_years <- 18

tuition_fv_year1 <- (1 + inflation) ^ college_start_years * tuition_today

cat("Tuition will be", paste0("C$",round(tuition_fv_year1,2), 
                              " for the first year, 18 years from now."))

# Now lets calculate the tuition payments for the next 3 years
# Year 0 is 
df <- tibble(year = 1:4,
             tuition = c(tuition_fv_year1, rep(0,3))) %>%
  mutate(tuition = (1 + inflation)^(year - 1) * tuition_fv_year1)
print(df)

# Now we need to PV these payments at
# beginning of year 17

interest <- 6/100 # Expected returns

df <- df %>%
  mutate(pv = tuition / (1 + interest) ^ year)


fv_total_tuition <- sum(df$pv)

# Now its an annuity problem as before

annuity <- fv_total_tuition / (((1 + interest)^17 - 1) / interest)
