      <description>The CFA Institute conducts yearly exams which are taken by thousands of participants around the world. The passing rates for these exams is very low. Upon successfully completing the exam, candidates are given the title of a CFA Charterholder. The CFA charter is great and covers many topics, but the exams are conducted using pencil and a calculator. It is our opinion, that a modern analyst must be comfortable to solve the problems using a computer programs (Excel, Python or R).</description>

      <description>Static charts are great for visualization, but there are times when we want to “wow” the audience with chart animations for dramatic effect. Lucky for us R has a great package that can help us create animated charts.
We will use the gganimate package to create animated charts.
You can install this by using the following command.
install.packages(&#34;gganimate&#34;)
We have already downloaded it so we will just run it below.</description>

      <description>“History doesn’t repeat itself, but it often rhymes”
--- Mark Twain
 The above quote is often repeated in the finance world. Past results in investing don’t usually repeat, but they often provide a resonable estimation of future returns. For that reason its important to learn how different asset classes have behaved in the past.
Unfortunately the long term returns from the past are not easily available for free.</description>

      <description>An import task for many investors is to keep up with what other prominent investors are buying or selling. Such information is not very easily available. One needs to check the 13F filings and parse the data out. Fortunately, there are several websites that display such data in a nice tabular format.
One such website is https://www.dataroma.com.
This website lists the updated portfolio of many prominent investors. In this post we will try to get the data for Warren Buffett’s portfolio.</description>

      <description>In the last post we performed several steps in downloading and analyzing the fund performance data. We used the Fama French’s 3 factor model to analyze Fidelity Contrafund Fund (FCNTX). In this post we will repeat the same steps without all the explanation. We will try to make things clear using the comments in our code. So lets begin by loading all the modules we will need to run our analysis.</description>

      <description>In the previous two posts we learned how to download and clean the Fama French 3 factors data. In this post we will use those factors to analyze mutual funds performance.
But before we proceed let us understand what Fama French factor model really is.
The traditional asset pricing model (CAPM), used only one factor (Market returns) to explain the returns of a portfolio or a stock. Fama &amp;amp; French concluded that CAPM model was not sufficient to explain all the sources of returns for a portfolio.</description>

      <description>In this post we will download and clean the Fama/French 3 factors model data. First we will download the data like we did in the previous post.
To keep it brief we will execute the entire code at once.
import urllib.request import zipfile ff_url = &amp;quot;https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/ftp/F-F_Research_Data_Factors_CSV.zip&amp;quot; # Download the file and save it # We will name it fama_french.zip file urllib.request.urlretrieve(ff_url,&amp;#39;fama_french.zip&amp;#39;) zip_file = zipfile.ZipFile(&amp;#39;fama_french.zip&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;r&amp;#39;) # Next we extact the file data # We will call it ff_factors.</description>

      <description>In the last post we learned to download the FF data. In this post we will learn to clean the data so we can use it for our analysis.
First lets load the libraries and the data.

      <description>We will perform the same step as we did in the last post. This time we will do it in Python. We will need a few libraries to download our data. We will use the urllib.request for downloading the file and zipfile to extract the content of the zip file.
import urllib.request import zipfile Once we have imported the modules, we are ready to download the files from the website.</description>

      <description>In this post we will show you how to use R to download Fama French 3 factor model data from their website. You can find the data on their website at “https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html” We will select and download the Fama/French 3 factors monthly data.
Lets begin!
Since we will just be learning how to download the data and not perform any analysis, we won’t need to load any libraries.
First we will need to copy the link of the data that we are trying to download.</description>

      <description>Portfolio optimization is an important topic in Finance. Modern portfolio theory (MPT) states that investors are risk averse and given a level of risk, they will choose the portfolios that offer the most return. To do that we need to optimize the portfolios.
To perform the optimization we will need
 To download the price data of the assets Calculate the mean returns for the time period Assign random weights to the assets and then use those to build an efficient frontier  So lets begin</description>

library(tidyquant) Then lets load the ticker symbols for our assets that we will include in our portfolio.
# Asset tickers tickers = c(&amp;#39;BND&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;VB&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;VEA&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;VOO&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;VWO&amp;#39;) We will also create a vector for our asset weights.</description>

      <description>Calculating portfolio returns in Python In this post we will learn to calculate the portfolio returns in Python. Since we are not aware of any modules that perform such calculations we will perform this calculation manually.
Calculating portfolio returns using the formula A portfolio return is the weighted average of individual assets in the portfolio.
Here is what we need
 Asset symbols that make up our portfolio Price data for the assets weights of assets Calculating the weighted average of our assets returns Adding them to get the portfolio returns  Lets first load the modules</description>

      <description>Calculating financial returns in Python One of the most important tasks in financial markets is to analyze historical returns on various investments. To perform this analysis we need historical data for the assets. There are many data providers, some are free most are paid. In this chapter we will use the data from Yahoo’s finance website. In python we can do this using the pandas-datareader module.

      <description>Retirement problem In the previous posts and examples we saw how saving at different age/time period can affect the amount one has in retirement. Now lets go up a notch in complexity. In this example we look at the similar problem but from another angle.
Suppose we have an individual Jack who is currently 55 years old and intends to retire at 60 (5 years to retirement). Jack expects to live only 10 years after his retirement.</description>

      <description>Calculating IRR in Python Calculation of IRR in Python is easy with the numpy module.
Why do we need to calculate the IRR or Internal rate of returns?
Let us suppose a manager has an opportunity to invest in two projects, but can only choose one project. The projects are:
Project 1 requires $800 million in investment today, but it will pay 200,250,300,350,400 million in payments each year for the next 5 years.</description>

      <description>In this article we will perform basic financial calculations in R.
Calculating the Net Present Value (NPV) Financial problems such as valuing an asset can be solved by calculating its net present value. The underlying principle in the calculation is that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar a year from now. This principle was well known to our ancestors thousands of year ago.</description>
