      <description>Calculating portfolio returns in RIn this post we will learn to calculate portfolio returns using R. Initially we will do this manually and then use the tidyquant package to calculate the portfolio returns for our purpose.
Calculating portfolio returns using the formulaA portfolio return is the weighted average of indidual assets in the portfolio.
Here is what we need
Asset symbols that make up our portfolioPrice data for the assetsweights of assetsCalculating the weighted average of our assets returnsAdding them to get the portfolio returnsLets first load the packages</description>

      <description>Calculating financial returns in PythonOne of the most important tasks in financial markets is to analyze historical returns on various investments. To perform this analysis we need historical data for the assets. There are many data providers, some are free most are paid. In this chapter we will use the data from Yahoo’s finance website. In python we can do this using the pandas-datareader module.

      <description>Retirement problemIn the previos posts and examples we saw how saving at different age/time period can affect the amount one has in retirement. Now lets go up a notch in complexity. In this example we look at the similar problem but from another angle.
Suppose we have an individual Jack who is currently 55 years old and intends to retire at 60 (5 years to retirement). Jack expects to live only 10 years after his retirement.</description>

      <description>Calculating the potential future value of Bitcoin InvestmentThe year 2017 was a great year for cryptocurrencies and in particular for the crypto leader Bitcoin. Many people called crypotcurrencies the future of money, but so far 2018 has been lousy. The crypto currency advocates argue that the value of will increase in the future. We have seen many claims, from $50000 to $1000000 per bitcoin. We take no sides and the Market will decide the future.</description>

      <description>Calculating the car loan paymentsLet’s say that you want to purchase a car for $15000. You only have $5000. A bank offers you $10000 at 7% interest which you have to pay back in 5 years. What is your yearly payment for the car?
Here is what we know
Car price $15000Loan amount $10000Interest rates 7% per yearDuration 5 yearsPayments ? - We need to solve for this.</description>

      <description>Calculating IRR in PythonCalculation of IRR in Python is easy with the numpy module.
Why do we need to calculate the IRR or Internal rate of returns?
Let us suppose a manager has an opportunity to invest in two projects, but can only choose one project. The projects are:
Project 1 requires $800 million in investment today, but it will pay 200,250,300,350,400 million in payments each year for the next 5 years.</description>

      <description>In this article we will perform the same time value of money calculations using Python. First let us import the necessary modules/libraries.
import pandas as pdimport numpy as npimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltCreating a pandas dataframe.
# Setting interest rate to 5%r = 0.05cf = pd.DataFrame({&amp;#39;Year&amp;#39;:[1,2,3,4,5], &amp;quot;cash_flow&amp;quot;:[100,100,100,100,100]})cf[&amp;quot;pv&amp;quot;] = cf[&amp;#39;cash_flow&amp;#39;] / (1.0 + r)**cf[&amp;#39;Year&amp;#39;]npv = cf[&amp;quot;pv&amp;quot;].sum()print(cf)## Year cash_flow pv## 0 1 100 95.</description>

      <description>In this article we will perform basic financial calculations in R.
Calculating the Net Present Value (NPV)Financial problems such as valuing an asset can be solved by calculating its net present value. The underlying principle in the calculation is that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar a year from now. This principle was well known to our ancestors thousands of year ago.</description>
