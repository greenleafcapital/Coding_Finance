<p>The CFA Institute conducts yearly exams which are taken by thousands of participants around the world. The passing rates for these exams is <a href="https://www.cfainstitute.org/en/programs/cfa/exam/results-info">very low</a>. Upon successfully completing the exam, candidates are given the title of a CFA Charterholder. The CFA charter is great and covers many topics, but the exams are conducted using pencil and a calculator. It is our opinion, that a modern analyst must be comfortable to solve the problems using a computer programs (Excel, Python or R).</p>
<p>In the following few posts we will try to address this issue. We will try to solve the practice problems using Python or R (mostly R). We assume that the student has access to the course materials. If you have a CFA membership you can access the course materials on <a href="https://www.cfainstitute.org/en/about/universities/professors/teaching-materials/quantitative-investment-analysis">CFAâ€™s</a> website and then simply search for the topics we discuss.</p>
<p>We will be solving the practice problems from the excellent book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Quantitative-Investment-Analysis-CFA-Institute/dp/111910422X">Quantitative Investment Analysis</a></p>
