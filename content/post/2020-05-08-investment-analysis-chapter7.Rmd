In this post we will solve the end of the chapter practice problems from chapter 7 of the [book](https://www.amazon.com/Quantitative-Investment-Analysis-CFA-Institute/dp/111910422X).

### Problem 1

Which of the following statements about hypothesis testing is correct?

- A The null hypothesis is the condition a researcher hopes to support.
- B The alternative hypothesis is the proposition considered true without conclusive
evidence to the contrary.
- C The alternative hypothesis exhausts all potential parameter values not
accounted for by the null hypothesis.

- C The alternative hypothesis exhausts all potential parameter values not
accounted for by the null hypothesis.

### Problem 2

A - We conduct the t-test with (15 - 1) = 14 degrees of freedom.

B - We conduct the t-test with (40 - 1) = 39 degrees of freedom.

C - We conduct the z-statistic test since the sample comes from a normal distribution

D - We conduct the chi-square test with (50 -1) = 49 degress of freedom

E - We conduct the F-statistic test

cat("For significant level of", a, "the rejection values are less than", lower)


```

For significant level of 0.05 the rejection values are less than -1.676551

### Problem 4

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greenleafcapital/cf_images/master/ch7_Hyp_testing/prob_4.png)

```{r}

# alpha

cat("The rejection areas are greater than", upper)


```

D - The rejection areas are greater than 1.644854

### Problem 5

Willco is a manufacturer in a mature cyclical industry. During the most recent
industry cycle, its net income averaged $30 million per year with a standard
deviation of $10 million (n = 6 observations). Management claims that Willco’s
performance during the most recent cycle results from new approaches and
that we can dismiss profitability expectations based on its average or normalized
earnings of $24 million per year in prior cycles.

- A With μ as the population value of mean annual net income, formulate null
and alternative hypotheses consistent with testing Willco management’s
claim.
- B Assuming that Willco’s net income is at least approximately normally distributed,
identify the appropriate test statistic.
- C Identify the rejection point or points at the 0.05 level of significance for the
hypothesis tested in Part A.
- D Determine whether or not to reject the null hypothesis at the 0.05 significance
level.

Answer A

Null hypothesis is mean earnings <= 24<br>
Alternative hypothesis is mean earnings > 24

Answer B

We will conduct a t-statistic test with (6 - 1) = 5, degress of freedom.

```{r}

# alpha 
a <- 0.05

size <- 6

df <- size - 1

upper <- qt(a, df = df, lower.tail = F)

cat("Reject the Null hypothesis if value is above", upper)

```

Answer C

Reject the Null hypothesis if value is above 2.015048


```{r}

# new mean

m <- 30

# pop mean

mu <- 24


# sd

s <- 10

n <- 6

# standard Error se
se <- s/sqrt(n)

# test

t <- (m - mu) / se

if (t > upper) {
  cat("We reject the null hypothesis since test statistic", t," is greater than", upper)
} else {
  
  cat("We do not reject the null hypothesis since test statistic", t,"is not greater than", upper)
}

```

Answer D

Since this value is less that 2.015, we do not reject the null hypothesis.

### Problem 6

Investment analysts often use earnings per share (EPS) forecasts. One test of
forecasting quality is the zero-mean
test, which states that optimal forecasts
should have a mean forecasting error of 0. (Forecasting error = Predicted value
of variable − Actual value of variable.)
You have collected data (shown in the table above) for two analysts who cover
two different industries: Analyst A covers the telecom industry; Analyst B covers
automotive parts and suppliers.

- A With μ as the population mean forecasting error, formulate null and alternative
hypotheses for a zero-mean
test of forecasting quality.
- B For Analyst A, using both a t-test and a z-test, determine whether to reject
the null at the 0.05 and 0.01 levels of significance.
- C For Analyst B, using both a t-test and a z-test, determine whether to reject
the null at the 0.05 and 0.01 levels of significance

Answer A

Null hypothesis is mean = 0<br>
Alternative hypothesis is mean not equal to 0

Answer B

```{r}

size <- 101

# mean
m <- 0.05

# sd
s <- 0.1
se <- s / sqrt(size)

# Levels for 0.05 significance

# alpha 0.05
a_5 <- 0.05

upper_5 <- qt(a_5/2, df = size - 1, lower.tail = F)
lower_5 <- qt(a_5/2, df = size - 1)

cat("At 0.05 significance level the upper and lover levels are", upper_5, 'and', lower_5)
cat("\n")

# Levels for 0.01 significance

# alpha 0.05
a_1 <- 0.01

upper_1 <- qt(a_1/2, df = size - 1, lower.tail = F)
lower_1 <- qt(a_1/2, df = size - 1)

cat("At 0.01 significance level the upper and lover levels are", upper_1, 'and', lower_1)
cat("\n")

# Test at 0.05 signi

t <- (m - 0) / se

cat("The test statistic is", t)


```
Since the test statistic is greater than 5.02, we can reject the null hypothesis at both 0.05 and 0.01 level.

Answer C

```{r}

size <- 121

# mean
m <- 0.02

# sd
s <- 0.09
se <- s / sqrt(size)

# Levels for 0.05 significance

# alpha 0.05
a_5 <- 0.05

upper_5 <- qt(a_5/2, df = size - 1, lower.tail = F)
lower_5 <- qt(a_5/2, df = size - 1)

cat("At 0.05 significance level the upper and lover levels are", upper_5, 'and', lower_5)
cat("\n")

# Levels for 0.01 significance

# alpha 0.05
a_1 <- 0.01

upper_1 <- qt(a_1/2, df = size - 1, lower.tail = F)
lower_1 <- qt(a_1/2, df = size - 1)

cat("At 0.01 significance level the upper and lover levels are", upper_1, 'and', lower_1)
cat("\n")

# Test at 0.05 signi

t <- (m - 0) / se

cat("The test statistic is", t)



```

Since the test statistic is 2.44, we can reject the null hypothesis at 0.05 level. But 2.44 is less than 2.61, hence we cannot reject the null hypothesis at the 0.01 level of significance.

### Problem 7

Reviewing the EPS forecasting performance data for Analysts A and B, you
want to investigate whether the larger average forecast errors of Analyst A are
due to chance or to a higher underlying mean value for Analyst A. Assume that
the forecast errors of both analysts are normally distributed and that the samples
are independent.

- A Formulate null and alternative hypotheses consistent with determining
whether the population mean value of Analyst A’s forecast errors (μ1) are
larger than Analyst B’s (μ2).
- B Identify the test statistic for conducting a test of the null hypothesis formulated
in Part A.
- C Identify the rejection point or points for the hypothesis tested in Part A, at
the 0.05 level of significance.
- D Determine whether or not to reject the null hypothesis at the 0.05 level of
significance.

Answer A

μ1 = the population mean value of Analyst A’s forecast errors <br>
μ2 = the population mean value of Analyst B’s forecast errors

Null Hypothesis μ1 - μ2 <= 0<br>
Alternative Hypothesis μ1 - μ2 > 0

Answer B

Appropriate test is t-statistics using a pooled estimate of common variance and (101 + 121 - 2) = 220 degrees of freedom.

Answer C

```{r}

# alpha
a <- 0.05

df = 220

t <- qt(a, df = df, lower.tail = F)
cat("We will reject the null hypothesis if the value is above", t)

```

Answer D

Using the formula for pooled variance

![](https://media.cheggcdn.com/study/346/3469010f-331f-401c-96be-89174e01d391/CL-589V1.png)

We find out the pooled estimate of variance

```{r}
# pooled variance
v <- (((101 - 1) * (0.1) ^ 2) + ((121 - 1) * (0.09) ^ 2)) / (101 + 121 - 2)
v
```

The t test is

![](http://www.stat.yale.edu/Courses/1997-98/101/tstat2.gif)

```{r}

a <- 0.05
df <- 220

t_1 <- qt(a, df = df, lower.tail = F)

t <- ((0.05 - 0.02) - 0) / ((v / 101 + v / 121) ^ (1/2))

if (t > t_1) {
  cat("We reject the null hypothesis since test statistic", t," is greater than", t_1)
} else {
  
  cat("We do not reject the null hypothesis since test statistic", t,"is not greater than", t_1)
}

```

### Problem 8

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greenleafcapital/cf_images/master/ch7_Hyp_testing/prob_8.png)

- A Formulate null and alternative hypotheses consistent with testing whether
any difference exists between the mean returns on the S&P 500 and small-cap
stocks.
- B Determine whether or not to reject the null hypothesis at the 0.05 significance
level for the entire sample period.
- C Determine whether or not to reject the null hypothesis at the 0.05 significance
level for the first subperiod.
- D Determine whether or not to reject the null hypothesis at the 0.05 significance
level for the second subperiod.

Answer A

Let μd stand for the population mean value of difference between S&P 500
returns and small-cap stock returns.

Null hypothesis is μd = 0<br>
Alternative hypothesis is μd != 0

Answer B

```{r}

# alpha 
a <- 0.05
n <- 480
df <- n - 1

upper <- qt(a/2, df = df, lower.tail = F)
lower <- qt(a/2, df = df, lower.tail = T)

cat("We will reject the null hypothesis if the test value is greater than", upper, "or less than", lower, "\n")

# mean difference
m <- -0.258
s <- 3.752

t <- (m - 0) / (s / sqrt(n))

if (t > upper) {
  cat("We reject the null hypothesis since test statistic", t," is greater than", upper)
} else if (t < lower) {
  
  cat("We reject the null hypothesis since test statistic", t," is less than", lower)
} else {
  cat("We do not reject the null hypothesis since test statistic", t,"is not greater than", upper, "or less than", lower)
}

```

At 0.05 significan level we do not reject the null hypothesis.

Answer C

```{r}

# alpha 
a <- 0.05

# first sub period
n <- 240
df <- n - 1

upper <- qt(a/2, df = df, lower.tail = F)
lower <- qt(a/2, df = df, lower.tail = T)

cat("We will reject the null hypothesis if the test value is greater than", upper, "or less than", lower, "\n")

# mean difference
m <- -0.640
s <- 4.096

t <- (m - 0) / (s / sqrt(n))

if (t > upper) {
  cat("We reject the null hypothesis since test statistic", t," is greater than", upper)
} else if (t < lower) {
  
  cat("We reject the null hypothesis since test statistic", t," is less than", lower)
} else {
  cat("We do not reject the null hypothesis since test statistic", t,"is not greater than", upper, "or less than", lower)
}


```

At a 0.05 level of significance, we reject the null hypothesis. During this period small cap stocks significantly outperformed S&P 500 stocks.

Answer D

```{r}

# alpha 
a <- 0.05

# secod sub period
n <- 240
df <- n - 1

upper <- qt(a/2, df = df, lower.tail = F)
lower <- qt(a/2, df = df, lower.tail = T)

cat("We will reject the null hypothesis if the test value is greater than", upper, "or less than", lower, "\n")

# mean difference
m <- 0.125
s <- 3.339

t <- (m - 0) / (s / sqrt(n))

if (t > upper) {
  cat("We reject the null hypothesis since test statistic", t," is greater than", upper)
} else if (t < lower) {
  
  cat("We reject the null hypothesis since test statistic", t," is less than", lower)
} else {
  cat("We do not reject the null hypothesis since test statistic", t,"is not greater than", upper, "or less than", lower)
}


```
At 0.05 significan level, we do not reject the null hypothesis.

### Problem 9

During a 10-year
period, the standard deviation of annual returns on a portfolio
you are analyzing was 15 percent a year. You want to see whether this record
is sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that the portfolio’s underlying
variance of return was less than 400, the return variance of the portfolio’s
benchmark.

- A Formulate null and alternative hypotheses consistent with the verbal
description of your objective.
- B Identify the test statistic for conducting a test of the hypotheses in Part A.
- C Identify the rejection point or points at the 0.05 significance level for the
hypothesis tested in Part A.
- D Determine whether the null hypothesis is rejected or not rejected at the 0.05
level of significance.


Answer A

Null hypothesis is portfolio variance is greater than or equal to 400<br>
Alternative hypothesis is portfolio variance is less than 400

Answer B

The test statistic is chi-square test with (10 - 1) = 9 degrees of freedom

Answer C

```{r}

# alpha
a <- 0.05

df <- 10 - 1

level <- qchisq(a,df)

cat("We will reject the null hypothesis if test statistic is less than", level)

```


Answer D

![](https://www.empirical-methods.hslu.ch/files/2017/02/calculating-the-chi-square-test-statistic-for-variance.png)

```{r}

t <- ((10 - 1) * 15**2) / (400)

if (t < level) {
  
  cat("Reject the null hypothesis since", t, "is less than", level)
  
} else {
  
  cat("Do not reject the null hypothesis since", t, "is not less than", level)
  
}

```

### Problem 10

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greenleafcapital/cf_images/master/ch7_Hyp_testing/prob_10.png)

Answer A

We are investigating whether population variance of the index has changed subsequent to the October 1987 crash.

Null hypothesis is variance before is equal to variance after<br>
Alternative hypothesis is variance before is not equal to variance afterwards

Answer B

To test the hypothesis, we use the F-test

![](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ca4dd5fb08a60b6a2000d07569e42eb324c2fbf6)

Answer C

```{r}

# alpha
a <- 0.05
df1 <- 119
df2 <- 119
critical_value <- qf(1 - a/2, df1 = df1, df2 = df2)

var_before <- 22.367
var_after <- 15.795

f_stat <- var_before / var_after

if (f_stat > critical_value) {
  
  cat("We reject the Null hypothesis, since", f_stat, "is greater than", critical_value)
} else {
  
  cat("We do not reject the Null hypothesis, since", f_stat, "is less than", critical_value)
  
}

```

Since 1.416081 is less than 1.434859, we do not reject the null hypothesis that the before and after variances are equal.

### Problem 11

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greenleafcapital/cf_images/master/ch7_Hyp_testing/prob_11.png)

Instead of testing all the correlation, we will start with the smallest value. We will first test correlation between fund 3 and fund 4

We will use the following formula

![](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/e0810a6f2000a63525adbbd2f5e79db1f554057e)

```{r}

# Correlation of fund 3 and 4
c_3_4 <- 0.3102

# t test
# alpha
a <- 0.05
df <- 36 - 2

critical_value <- qt(a/2, df = df, lower.tail = F)


t <- c_3_4 * sqrt(df - 2 / (1 - c_3_4))

if (t > critical_value) {
  
  cat("We reject the null hypothesis since", t, "is greater than", critical_value)
  
} else {
  
  cat("We do not reject the null hypothesis since", t, "is less than", critical_value)
}

```
We can now try the next smallest correlation. Its the correlation between Fund 3 and Fund 2.

```{r}

# Correlation of fund 3 and 4
c_3_4 <- 0.4156

# t test
# alpha
a <- 0.05
df <- 36 - 2

critical_value <- qt(a/2, df = df, lower.tail = F)


t <- c_3_4 * sqrt(df - 2 / (1 - c_3_4))

if (t > critical_value) {
  
  cat("We reject the null hypothesis since", t, "is greater than", critical_value)
  
} else {
  
  cat("We do not reject the null hypothesis since", t, "is less than", critical_value)

}


```

At a 0.05 level we can reject the null hypothesis. Since all other correlation are larger than this, we can assume they are all statistically significant.

|---------------|:-------------:|
|A| No            | No            |
|B| No            | Yes           |

"

cat(tabl)
```

The following table shows the significance level (α) and the p-value for three
hypothesis tests.

```{r}

tabl <- "  # Problem 30 Table
| Test        | alpha| p-value|
|-------------|:----:|-------:|
| Test 1      | 0.05 | 0.10 |
| Test 2      | 0.10 | 0.08 |
| Test 3      | 0.10 | 0.05 |
"
cat(tabl)


```

The evidence for rejecting H0 is strongest for:

- A Test 1.
- B Test 2.
- C Test 3.

C - Test 3

### Problem 31

Which of the following tests of a hypothesis concerning the population mean is
most appropriate?

- A A z-test if the population variance is unknown and the sample is small
- B A z-test if the population is normally distributed with a known variance
- C A t-test if the population is non-normally distributed with unknown variance and a small sample

B - A z-test if the population is normally distributed with a known variance

### Problem 32

For a small sample with unknown variance, which of the following tests of a
hypothesis concerning the population mean is most appropriate?

- A A t-test if the population is normally distributed
- B A t-test if the population is non-normally
distributed
- C A z-test regardless of the normality of the population distribution

A - A t-test if the population is normally distributed

### Problem 33

For a small sample from a normally distributed population with unknown variance,
the most appropriate test statistic for the mean is the:

- A z-statistic.
- B t-statistic.
- C χ2 statistic.

B - t-statistic.

### Problem 34

An investment consultant conducts two independent random samples of 5-year
performance data for US and European absolute return hedge funds. Noting
a 50 basis point return advantage for US managers, the consultant decides
to test whether the two means are statistically different from one another at
a 0.05 level of significance. The two populations are assumed to be normally
distributed with unknown but equal variances. Results of the hypothesis test are
contained in the tables below.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greenleafcapital/cf_images/master/ch7_Hyp_testing/prob_32.png)

A - null hypothesis is not rejected.

### Problem 35

A pooled estimator is used when testing a hypothesis concerning the:

- A equality of the variances of two normally distributed populations.
- B difference between the means of two at least approximately normally distributed
populations with unknown but assumed equal variances.
- C difference between the means of two at least approximately normally distributed
populations with unknown and assumed unequal variances.

B - difference between the means of two at least approximately normally distributed
populations with unknown but assumed equal variances.

### Problem 36

When evaluating mean differences between two dependent samples, the most
appropriate test is a:

- A chi-square
test.
- B paired comparisons test.
- C z-test.

B - paired comparisons test.

### Problem 37

A fund manager reported a 2% mean quarterly return over the past ten years for
its entire base of 250 client accounts that all follow the same investment strategy.
A consultant employing the manager for 45 client accounts notes that their
mean quarterly returns were 0.25% less over the same period. The consultant
tests the hypothesis that the return disparity between the returns of his clients
and the reported returns of the fund manager’s 250 client accounts are significantly
different from zero.
Assuming normally distributed populations with unknown population variances,
the most appropriate test statistic is:

- A a paired comparisons t-test.
- B a t-test of the difference between the two population means.
- C an approximate t-test of mean differences between the two populations.

A - a paired comparisons t-test.

### Problem 38

A chi-square
test is most appropriate for tests concerning:

- A a single variance.
- B differences between two population means with variances assumed to be
equal.
- C differences between two population means with variances assumed to not
be equal.

A - a single variance.

### Problem 39

Which of the following should be used to test the difference between the variances
of two normally distributed populations?

- A t-test
- B F-test
- C Paired comparisons test

B - F-test

### Problem 40

Jill Batten is analyzing how the returns on the stock of Stellar Energy Corp. are
related with the previous month’s percent change in the US Consumer Price
Index for Energy (CPIENG). Based on 248 observations, she has computed the
sample correlation between the Stellar and CPIENG variables to be −0.1452.
She also wants to determine whether the sample correlation is statistically
significant. The critical value for the test statistic at the 0.05 level of significance
is approximately 1.96. Batten should conclude that the statistical relationship
between Stellar and CPIENG is:

- A significant, because the calculated test statistic has a lower absolute value
than the critical value for the test statistic.
- B significant, because the calculated test statistic has a higher absolute value
than the critical value for the test statistic.
- C not significant, because the calculated test statistic has a higher absolute
value than the critical value for the test statistic.

```{r}
# Correlation
r <- -0.1452

n <- 248

# Test staistic
t <- r * sqrt((n - 2) / (1 - r**2))


# Critical value is
critical_value <- 1.96

if (abs(critical_value) > t) {
  
  cat("The correlation coefficient is statistically significant since", abs(t), "greater than", critical_value)
}

```


B - significant, because the calculated test statistic has a higher absolute value
than the critical value for the test statistic.

### Problem 41

In which of the following situations would a non-parametric
test of a hypothesis
most likely be used?

- A The sample data are ranked according to magnitude.
- B The sample data come from a normally distributed population.
- C The test validity depends on many assumptions about the nature of the
population.

A - The sample data are ranked according to magnitude.

### Problem 42

An analyst is examining the monthly returns for two funds over one year. Both
funds’ returns are non-normally
distributed. To test whether the mean return of
one fund is greater than the mean return of the other fund, the analyst can use:

- A a parametric test only.
- B a nonparametric test only.
- C both parametric and nonparametric tests.

B - a nonparametric test only.
