<p>In this article we will perform basic financial calculations in R.</p>
<div id="calculating-the-net-present-value-npv" class="section level2">
<h2>Calculating the Net Present Value (NPV)</h2>
<p>Financial problems such as valuing an asset can be solved by calculating its net present value. The underlying principle in the calculation is that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar a year from now. This principle was well known to our ancestors thousands of year ago.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A bird in hand is worth two in the bush.</p>
<p>— Aesop’s Fables</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So a stream of cash flows that we will receive in the future have to be discounted to calculate the net present value. We will see some methods to discount this cash flow in the following sections.</p>
<p>First we begin by loading all the libraries.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># We will be using the folowing libraries for this chapter

library(tidyquant) # For financial data
library(DT) # to create pretty tables

options(digits = 3, scipen = 100)</code></pre>
<p>Let us take the following example. If we receive $100 per year for the next five years what is the net present value if the current interest rates are 5%. Let us set up our cash flow table.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Creating a variable r for interest rates and the cash flow table

r &lt;- 0.05  

# cf is the table for our data

<div id="calculating-the-present-value-of-a-finite-annuity" class="section level3">
<h3>Calculating the present value of a finite annuity</h3>
<p>In some cases we have to calculate the present value of stream of equal payments. Many times a lottery winner is given the option to get the money in equal payments or a lump sum. Let us suppose you win a $50000 lottery and you are given two options</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Receive five equal payments of $10000</li>
<li>Lump sum $45000.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let us suppose the bank pays 5% interest rate on the deposit.</p>
<p>At first glance it may appear that five equal payments of $10000 is better than $45000. After all $50000 is more than $45000.
To solve this problem we can calculate the net present value of those payments as below.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pmt &lt;- 10000                #payments
n &lt;- 5                      # Years 
r &lt;- 0.05                   # interest rates

cf &lt;- tibble(period = 1:5,
             pmt = pmt)

npv &lt;- cf %&gt;%
  mutate(pv = pmt/(1+r)^period) %&gt;%
  select(pv) %&gt;%
  sum()</code></pre>
<p>The net present value of five equal payments is 43294.767. This payment is less that $45000 offered today. Therefore is better to take the lump sum payment of $45000 and deposit it in the bank than five equal payments of $10000.</p>

<h3>Calculating the present value infinite annuity</h3>
<p>Sometimes one can buy an infinite payment stream. Bank of England issued such bonds that paid interest forever. How can we calculate the net present value of such bonds. Let us suppose we are given an offer to buy a bond that pays $1000 per year in interest forever. If the current interest rate is 5%, how much should we pay for this bond? We can do the calculation as below.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>cf &lt;- 1000 # Interest paid each year
r &lt;- 0.05 # Interest rate 5%

value &lt;- cf/r</code></pre>
<p>The value of this bond is 20000</p>

<div id="calculating-present-value-of-finite-growing-annuity" class="section level3">
<h3>Calculating present value of finite growing annuity</h3>
<p>There are cases when when an investor may be offered a stream of payments that grow at a certain rate. Suppose you own an apartment complex. The tenants pay you a fixed rent every month. You can increase the rent to tackle higher inflation. This apartment building may be described as an annuity payment that grows at the rate of inflation. We can calculate the present value of those payments as below.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>payment &lt;- 1000
growth &lt;- 0.03 # Growth rate of payments
n &lt;- 5 # years
rate &lt;- 0.06 # Interest rate

# Creating the tibble

cf &lt;- tibble(period = 1:5,
             cf = 1000)

 # making the cash flow grow at 3% per year

cf &lt;- cf %&gt;%
  mutate(cf = payment*(1+growth)^(period - 1)) 

cf &lt;- cf %&gt;%
  mutate(pv = cf/(1+rate)^period)

<h3>Calculating present value of infinite growing annuity</h3>
<p>In case of infinite payment stream that grows at a certain rate, we simply subtract the growth rate from the current interest rate as shown below.</p>
<p>Suppose you get paid $100 per year forever, and this payment grows at 3% each year. What is the net present value of this payment stream.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>payment &lt;- 100
growth &lt;- 0.03

<p>We can use the above formula to calculate the calculate the Future value of a stream of payments. For example if we are promised $100 per year for 5 years at 5% interest rate, what is the future value of such a payment.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Lets create our table
