<p>In this post we will solve the end of the chapter practice problems from chapter 1 of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Quantitative-Investment-Analysis-CFA-Institute/dp/111910422X">book</a>.</p>
<p>Here are the first 4 problems and their solutions in R</p>

<div id="problem-1a" class="section level3">
<h3>Problem 1A</h3>
<p>Investment 1 and 2 have the same maturity and default risks. However investment 2 has low liquidity and therefore investment 2 has a higher interest rate of 0.5% to compensate for the liquidity risk. This is the liquidity risk premium.</p>
</div>
<div id="problem-1b" class="section level3">
<h3>Problem 1B</h3>
<p>Investment 4 and 5 have the same maturity (8 years). We know from problem 1 the liquidity risk premiums is 0.5%. The interest rate difference between Investment 4 and 5, is 2.5%. Investment 5 has low liquidity and high default risk therefore it has a higher interest rate. Since we know 0.5% is the liquidity premium, we can attribute 2.5% - 0.5% = 2% as default risk premium.</p>
</div>
<div id="problem-1c" class="section level3">
<h3>Problem 1C</h3>
<p>Investment 2 and 3 has the same liquidity and default risk, but investment 3 has a higher maturity hence it should have atleast 2.5% as the lower bound. Investment 3 and 4 has low default risk. But investment 3 has a lower maturity and lower liquidity. We know the liquidity premium is 0.5%, but we donâ€™t know the compensation for extra year of maturity. Therefore we could expect the interest rate for investment 3 to be between 2.5% and 4.5%.</p>
