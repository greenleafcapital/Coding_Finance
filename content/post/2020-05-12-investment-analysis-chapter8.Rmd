In this post we will solve the end of the chapter practice problems from chapter 7 of the [book](https://www.amazon.com/Quantitative-Investment-Analysis-CFA-Institute/dp/111910422X).

### Problem 1

Julie Moon is an energy analyst examining electricity, oil, and natural gas
consumption in different regions over different seasons. She ran a regression
explaining the variation in energy consumption as a function of temperature.
The total variation of the dependent variable was 140.58, the explained variation
was 60.16, and the unexplained variation was 80.42. She had 60 monthly
observations.

- A Compute the coefficient of determination.
- B What was the sample correlation between energy consumption and
temperature?
- C Compute the standard error of the estimate of Moon’s regression model.
- D Compute the sample standard deviation of monthly energy consumption.

```{r}

# total variation
t_v <- 140.58

# explained variation
e_v <- 60.16

# unexplained variation
ue_v <- 80.42

# Coef of determination
coef_d <- e_v / t_v

cat("The coefficient of determination is", coef_d)


```

A - The coefficient of determination is 0.4279414

```{r}

corr <- sqrt(coef_d)
cat("The sample correlation between energy consumption and temperature is", corr)

```

B - The sample correlation between energy consumption and temperature is 0.6541723

```{r}

# The standard error of the estimate is the square root of the
# coefficient of non-determination divided by it's degrees of freedom

# number of observations
n <- 60

# se
se <- sqrt(ue_v / (n - 2))

cat("The standard error of the estimate of Moon’s regression model is", se)

```
C- The standard error of the estimate of Moon’s regression model is 1.177519

```{r}

# The sample variance of the dependent variable is

sv <- t_v / (n - 1)

# sample standard deviation is

s <- sqrt(sv)

cat("The sample standard deviation of monthly energy consumption is", s)

```

D - The sample standard deviation of monthly energy consumption is 1.543604

### Problem 4

What is the value of the coefficient of determination?

- A 0.8261.
- B 0.7436.
- C 0.8623.

B - 0.7436

### Problem 5

Suppose that you deleted several of the observations that had small residual
values. If you re-estimated
the regression equation using this reduced sample,
what would likely happen to the standard error of the estimate and the
R-squared?

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greenleafcapital/cf_images/master/ch8_regression/prob_5.png)

C - Deleting observations with small residual values will increase standard error and decrease R-Squared

### Problem 6

What is the correlation between X and Y?

- A −0.7436.
- B 0.7436.
- C 0.8623.

```{r}

# Coef of Determination aka R-squared
coef_d <- 0.7436

corr <- sqrt(coef_d)
corr

```

C - 0.8623

### Problem 7

Where did the F-value in the ANOVA table come from?

- A You look up the F-value in a table. The F depends on the numerator and
denominator degrees of freedom.
- B Divide the “Mean Square” for the regression by the “Mean Square” of the
residuals.
- C The F-value is equal to the reciprocal of the t-value for the slope coefficient.

B - Divide the “Mean Square” for the regression by the “Mean Square” of the
residuals.

### Problem 8

If the ratio of net income to sales for a restaurant is 5 percent, what is the predicted
ratio of cash flow from operations to sales?

- A 0.007 + 0.103(5.0) = 0.524.
- B 0.077 − 0.826(5.0) = −4.054.
- C 0.077 + 0.826(5.0) = 4.207.

C - 0.077 + 0.826(5.0) = 4.207.

### Problem 9

Is the relationship between the ratio of cash flow to operations and the ratio of
net income to sales significant at the 5 percent level?

- A No, because the R-squared is greater than 0.05.
- B No, because the p-values of the intercept and slope are less than 0.05.
- C Yes, because the p-values for F and t for the slope coefficient are less than
0.05.

C - Yes, because the p-values for F and t for the slope coefficient are less than
0.05.
