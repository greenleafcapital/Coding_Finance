In this post we will solve the end of the chapter practice problems from chapter 4 of the [book](https://www.amazon.com/Quantitative-Investment-Analysis-CFA-Institute/dp/111910422X).

### Problem 1

Suppose that 5 percent of the stocks meeting your stock-selection criteria are in the telecommunications (telecom) industry. Also, dividend-paying telecom stocks are 1 percent of the total number of stocks meeting your selection cri-teria. What is the probability that a stock is dividend paying, given that it is a telecom stock that has met your stock selection criteria?

```{r}

# Probability stock is telecom
p_telecom <- 0.05

# Probability stock is dividend paying telecom stock
p_div_telecom <- 0.01

# Find
# p(stock_is_div | stock_is_telecom) = p(stock_is_div_telecom) / p(stock_is_telecom)

p <- p_div_telecom / p_telecom

cat("What is the probability that a stock is dividend paying, given that it is a telecom stock that has met your stock selection criteria is", p)

```

### Problem 2

You are using the following three criteria to screen potential acquisition targets from a list of 500 companies:
