In this post we will solve the end of the chapter practice problems from chapter 3 of the [book](https://www.amazon.com/Quantitative-Investment-Analysis-CFA-Institute/dp/111910422X).

#### Here are the first 6 problems and their solutions in R

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)

```

### Problem 1

B. The FTSE Eurotop 100 as a representation of the European stock market

### Problem 2

A. Ordinal

### Problem 3

A. The 500 companies in the S&P 500 Index

### Problem 4

A. median of a population.

### Problem 5

```{r}

df <- tibble(return_interval = c("-10 to -7", "-7 to -4", "-4 to -1", "-1 to 2", "2 to 5", "5 to 8"),
       absolute_freq = c(3,7,10,12,23,5)) %>%
  mutate(r_freq = absolute_freq / sum(.$absolute_freq)) %>%
  mutate(cum_sum = cumsum(r_freq))

df


```

A. The relative frequency of the interval “–1.0 to +2.0” is 20%.

### Problem 6

       returns = c(2.48, -2.59, 9.47, -0.55, -1.69, -0.89, -9.19, -5.11, 1.33, 6.84, 3.04, 4.72)) %>%
  group_by(group = cut(returns, breaks = 5)) %>%
  #group_by(group = cut(returns, breaks = seq(min(returns), max(returns), length = 5))) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>%
  mutate(rel_freq = n / sum(.$n)) %>%

### Problem 11

The following is a frequency polygon of monthly exchange rate changes in the US dollar/Japanese yen spot exchange rate for a four-year period. A positive change represents yen appreciation (the yen buys more dollars), and a negative change represents yen depreciation (the yen buys fewer dollars). (See chart above)

Based on the chart, yen appreciation:
- A. occurred more than 50% of the time.
- B. was less frequent than yen depreciation.
- C. in the 0.0 to 2.0 interval occurred 20% of the time.

A. occurred more than 50% of the time.

### Problem 12
