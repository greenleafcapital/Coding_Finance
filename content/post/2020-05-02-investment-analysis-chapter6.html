<p>In this post we will solve the end of the chapter practice problems from chapter 6 of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Quantitative-Investment-Analysis-CFA-Institute/dp/111910422X">book</a>.</p>
<div id="problem-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Problem 1</h3>
<p>Peter Biggs wants to know how growth managers performed last year. Biggs
assumes that the population cross-sectional
standard deviation of growth manager
returns is 6 percent and that the returns are independent across managers.</p>
<ul>
<li>A How large a random sample does Biggs need if he wants the standard deviation
of the sample means to be 1 percent?</li>
<li>B How large a random sample does Biggs need if he wants the standard deviation
of the sample means to be 0.25 percent?</li>
</ul>
<p>We know that</p>

<pre class="r"><code># Population sd is 0.06
pop_sd &lt;- 6/100

# The standard deviation or standard error of the sample mean is σX = σ / sqrt(n)
# 0.01 = pop_sd / sqrt(n)

n = (pop_sd / 0.01) ** 2

cat(&quot;Biggs need&quot;, n, &quot;samples, if he wants the standard deviation
    of the sample means to be 1 percent&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Biggs need 36 samples, if he wants the standard deviation
##     of the sample means to be 1 percent</code></pre>
<p>A - Biggs need 36 samples, if he wants the standard deviation of the sample means to be 1 percent</p>
<pre class="r"><code>n = (pop_sd / 0.0025) ** 2

cat(&quot;Biggs need&quot;, n, &quot;samples, if he wants the standard deviation
    of the sample means to be 0.25 percent&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Biggs need 576 samples, if he wants the standard deviation
##     of the sample means to be 0.25 percent</code></pre>
<p>B - Biggs need 576 samples, if he wants the standard deviation of the sample means to be 0.25 percent</p>
<p>As standard error decreases, the sample size increases.</p>

<h3>Problem 2</h3>
<p>Petra Munzi wants to know how value managers performed last year. Munzi
estimates that the population cross-sectional
standard deviation of value manager
returns is 4 percent and assumes that the returns are independent across
managers.</p>
<ul>
<li>A Munzi wants to build a 95 percent confidence interval for the mean return.
How large a random sample does Munzi need if she wants the 95 percent
confidence interval to have a total width of 1 percent?</li>
<li>B Munzi expects a cost of about $10 to collect each observation. If she has
a $1,000 budget, will she be able to construct the confidence interval she
wants?</li>
</ul>
