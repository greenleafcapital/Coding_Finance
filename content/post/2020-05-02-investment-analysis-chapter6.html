<p>In this post we will solve the end of the chapter practice problems from chapter 6 of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Quantitative-Investment-Analysis-CFA-Institute/dp/111910422X">book</a>.</p>

<h3>Problem 1</h3>
<p>Peter Biggs wants to know how growth managers performed last year. Biggs
assumes that the population cross-sectional
standard deviation of growth manager
returns is 6 percent and that the returns are independent across managers.</p>
<ul>
<li>A How large a random sample does Biggs need if he wants the standard deviation
of the sample means to be 1 percent?</li>
<li>B How large a random sample does Biggs need if he wants the standard deviation
of the sample means to be 0.25 percent?</li>
</ul>
<p>We know that</p>

<pre class="r"><code># Population sd is 0.06

# The standard deviation or standard error of the sample mean is σX = σ / sqrt(n)

n = (pop_sd / 0.01) ** 2

    of the sample means to be 1 percent&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Biggs need 36 samples, if he wants the standard deviation
##     of the sample means to be 1 percent</code></pre>
<p>A - Biggs need 36 samples, if he wants the standard deviation of the sample means to be 1 percent</p>
<pre class="r"><code>n = (pop_sd / 0.0025) ** 2

cat(&quot;Biggs need&quot;, n, &quot;samples, if he wants the standard deviation

##     of the sample means to be 0.25 percent</code></pre>
<p>B - Biggs need 576 samples, if he wants the standard deviation of the sample means to be 0.25 percent</p>
<p>As standard error decreases, the sample size increases.</p>

<h3>Problem 2</h3>
<p>Petra Munzi wants to know how value managers performed last year. Munzi
estimates that the population cross-sectional
standard deviation of value manager
returns is 4 percent and assumes that the returns are independent across
managers.</p>
<ul>
<li>A Munzi wants to build a 95 percent confidence interval for the mean return.
How large a random sample does Munzi need if she wants the 95 percent
confidence interval to have a total width of 1 percent?</li>
<li>B Munzi expects a cost of about $10 to collect each observation. If she has
a $1,000 budget, will she be able to construct the confidence interval she
wants?</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code># We know population sd

pop_sd &lt;- 0.04

# se is s/sqrt(n) # standard error
# we have to find n
# but before that we need to find se
# 95% confidence interval means
# 2.5% in each tail

lower_tail &lt;- qnorm(0.025, lower.tail = T)
uppper_tail &lt;- qnorm(0.025, lower.tail = F)

cat(&quot;lower tail&quot;, lower_tail,&quot;\n&quot;,
    &quot;upper tail&quot;, uppper_tail)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## lower tail -1.959964 
##  upper tail 1.959964</code></pre>
<p>So we need our 95% confidence interval to have a 1% width.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Assuming X as our mean and se as our sample sd
# We have (X + 1.96se) − (X − 1.96se) = 1% 
# which is equal to 2*(1.96se) = 1%
# se = 0.01 / (2 * 1.96)

se &lt;- 0.01 / (2 * uppper_tail)
cat(&quot;The standard deviation of sample mean is,&quot;, se, &quot;\n\n\n&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## The standard deviation of sample mean is, 0.002551067</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># Now find the n

n &lt;- (0.04 / se) ** 2
cat(&quot;Munzi needs a sample size of&quot;, round(n),  &quot;if she wants the 95 percent
confidence interval to have a total width of 1 percent&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Munzi needs a sample size of 246 if she wants the 95 percent
## confidence interval to have a total width of 1 percent</code></pre>
<p>A - Munzi needs a sample size of 246 if she wants the 95 percent
confidence interval to have a total width of 1 percent</p>
<p>B - With her $1000 budget Munzi can only afford 100 observations which is far short of 246 she needs to have a 1% width of her confidence interval.</p>

<h3>Problem 3</h3>
<p>Assume that the equity risk premium is normally distributed with a population
mean of 6 percent and a population standard deviation of 18 percent. Over
the last four years, equity returns (relative to the risk-free
rate) have averaged
−2.0 percent. You have a large client who is very upset and claims that results
this poor should never occur. Evaluate your client’s concerns.</p>
<ul>
<li>A Construct a 95 percent confidence interval around the population mean for
a sample of four-year
returns.</li>

four-year
