<p>In this post we will solve the end of the chapter practice problems from chapter 4 of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Quantitative-Investment-Analysis-CFA-Institute/dp/111910422X">book</a>.</p>
<div id="problem-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Problem 1</h3>
<p>Suppose that 5 percent of the stocks meeting your stock-selection criteria are in the telecommunications (telecom) industry. Also, dividend-paying telecom stocks are 1 percent of the total number of stocks meeting your selection cri-teria. What is the probability that a stock is dividend paying, given that it is a telecom stock that has met your stock selection criteria?</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Probability stock is telecom
p_telecom &lt;- 0.05

# Probability stock is dividend paying telecom stock
p_div_telecom &lt;- 0.01

# Find
# p(stock_is_div | stock_is_telecom) = p(stock_is_div_telecom) / p(stock_is_telecom)

p &lt;- p_div_telecom / p_telecom
