<h1>Calculating IRR in Python</h1>
<p>Calculation of IRR in Python is easy with the <code>numpy</code> module.</p>
<p>Why do we need to calculate the IRR or Internal rate of returns?</p>
<p>Let us suppose a manager has an opportunity to invest in two projects, but can only choose one project. The projects are:</p>
<p>Project 1 requires $800 million in investment today, but it will pay 200,250,300,350,400 million in payments each year for the next 5 years.</p>
<p>Project 2 required $500 million in investment today, but it will pay 150,170,178,250,300 in payments each year for the next 5 years.</p>
<p>How would the manager decide which project to choose? To solve this problem we need to calculate the IRR of the two projects. We show the solution below.</p>
<p>First let us import the libraries</p>
<pre class="python"><code>import pandas as pd
import numpy as np</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>project1_cf = pd.DataFrame({&quot;Year&quot;:np.arange(0,6),
&quot;cf&quot;: [-800,200,250,300,350,400]})
project2_cf = pd.DataFrame({&quot;Year&quot;:np.arange(0,6),
&quot;cf&quot;: [-500,150,170,178,250,300]})
print(project1_cf)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##    Year   cf
## 0     0 -800
## 1     1  200
## 2     2  250
## 3     3  300
## 4     4  350
## 5     5  400</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>print(project2_cf)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##    Year   cf
## 0     0 -500
## 1     1  150
## 2     2  170
## 3     3  178
## 4     4  250
## 5     5  300</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>irr1 = np.irr(project1_cf[&quot;cf&quot;])
irr2 = np.irr(project2_cf[&quot;cf&quot;])
irr_df = pd.DataFrame({&quot;Name&quot;:[&quot;Project1&quot;, &quot;Project2&quot;],
                      &quot;IRR&quot;:[irr1, irr2]})
print(irr_df)
                  </code></pre>
<pre><code>##        Name       IRR
## 0  Project1  0.221603
## 1  Project2  0.267620</code></pre>
<p>From the above table we can see that project 1 has an IRR of 22.16% and project 2 has an IRR of 26.76. Even though project 1 offers higher cash flows, project 1 has a lower internal rate of returns. If the managers goal is to choose the project that maximizes profitability then he/she should choose project 2.</p>
